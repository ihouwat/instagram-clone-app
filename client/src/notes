IMPORTANT
User feed and news feed are identical. Need to merge them 
  One solution: create post feed compoment in posts module and export that to user and news feeds
  Annoying part is that the user feed and news feed still share a layout component (perhaps make this into a shared 'body wrap component')

To dos found in:

- App routing module
  Remove 'user' from Users routing module
- User Management Service
  - isOwner flag to specify user permissions etc.
- Authentication Service
  Eventually need http interceptor service for 
    404 routing
    jwt safety
    routing to home OR login page
